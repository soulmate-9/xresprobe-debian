xresprobe (0.4.22) dapper; urgency=low

  * More AMD64 support.  Reset the stack pointer on each call to LRMI_int
    (unless overridden in regs).  Without this, the second call to
    LRMI_int will always fail due to the stack size being too small.

xresprobe (0.4.21) dapper; urgency=low

    and the people who wrote x86emu.
